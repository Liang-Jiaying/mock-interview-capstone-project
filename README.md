# Mock Interview Capstone Project Repository

I aim to develop a mock interview web application that DSI students can use to enhance their interview skills based on their resumes. Users can upload their resumes, prompting the chatbot to generate questions related to the information contained therein. The chatbot, utilizing natural language processing techniques, will produce bespoke interview questions and responses aligned with the user's resume and background. I plan to refine a pre-trained conversational AI model like GPT-3 using a dataset of interview questions, enabling it to naturally address common behavioral and technical inquiries in the data science domain. The project timeline is divided into four phases: curriculum study and data collection/processing, model development, model enhancement based on feedback from career coaches, and interface creation and refinement.

# Goal
**The application aims to resolve the following issues**:   
a.	Limited appointment slots available with CMC's career coaches for mock interviews.  
b.	Restricted time frames for practicing with CMC's career coaches.  
c.	Uncertainty about what to articulate during a mock interview.   
d.	Potential discomfort or embarrassment due to lack of preparation before the mock interview session.  
These obstacles can hinder students' interview preparation, but the proposed application seeks to mitigate these issues by offering flexible and round-the-clock practice sessions without the need for appointments and facilitating more focused feedback from career coaches.  

**Having this proposed application, students are able to benefit from following cases**:  
a.	Practice their interview skills anytime and anywhere. They do not need to stress out about the upcoming interviews that they have not got a slot for practice with CMC’s career coaches;  
b.	Practice as many times as they want. They can practice interview skills 24/7;  
c.	No longer need to worry about not prepare before doing mock interview with CMC’s career coaches;  
d.	This application can also help CMC’s career coaches to better help those students who prepared well and want some professional feedbacks before going to company interviews.
